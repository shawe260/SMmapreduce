1.  You can configure the system parameters in lib/header.h, such as the number of
    groups in each thread block (NUM_GROUPS), the number of thread blocks (NUM_BLOCKS)
    and the number of threads in each thread block (NUM_THREADS). You should also
    indicate whether shared memory is used based on the application. For KM,WC,NBC and 
    PVC, the shared memory should be used since it is reduction-intensive. You should also indicate
    whether use swapping or sorting when shared memory reduction object is full. For
    applications like kNN, sorting should be used.

2.  lib/common.h defines the system parameters like the bucket number in shared memory
    reduction object, the shared memory pool size, the bucket number in device memory
    reduction object, and the global memory pool size. SORT_REMAIN defines how many 
    key-value pairs should be kept after sorting the shared memory reduction object. 
    This parameter is only used when an application needs sorting as a overflow handling method.

3.  map and reduce functions are defined in mapreduce.h. Other help functions such as
    compare (used in sorting), equal (used in key-value pair inserting) are also defined here. 

4.  lib/hash.h defines the hash function used to hash a key. You can change the hash
    function according to the applications you are writting.

5.  To compile, you need to configure the NVCC installation path in Makefile. 
    Then type: make, the executable "main" will be generated.

6.  Input format:
    Each line follows the format like:
    www.google.com\t127.0.0.1
    Please generate input file by yourself before running.

7.  To run, use command ./main <file_name>.
